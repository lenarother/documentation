# Documentation Templates

### ðŸ¤  Data Fix

[Template](data_fix.md) to document a change in data.

Developers strive to avoid manipulation of production data. 
Still it may come to a situation when, because of a bug, 
some data requires a manual correction. 
It can lead to further errors as offen done without testing and under stress and time pressure. 
Documenting manual data fix can help to avoid problems, as it supports:

- prepare fix before it is done, so that it can be reviewed / tested / run
- information about fix and its date is easily available
- changed records can be traced
- change can be easily repeated if necessary


### ðŸ›  Tools

[Template](tools.md) to document tools used in the team.

Working on a large project often involves using multiple tools,
that help developers to handle deployment, logging, monitoring, translations, documentation, data storage, etc.
It is useful, especially for new members joining the team,
to have reference place that list used tools and points to appropriate how to articles and other documentation.
